### ***Overview***

this is the original dingusProxy, built entirely from scratch by dinguschan! this project will get constant updates, but dont even think about gettign a consistent update schedule. open an issue for any spelling mistakes you see, so that i can ignore, it mark it as closed, and tell you to get stuffed üëç. 

for all the lil idiot middle schoolers who searched "school proxy github" on their 200 dollar school chromebook, this thing is what you want. spyware and filters can't touch it. yes, its currently kinda shit, but again, constant updates. better than any other "uNbLoCkAbLe LoCaL wEb PrOxY" on the internet, trust. host this on Netlify, Heroku, Vercel, whatever. Copy and paste into Codepen, Replit, or any WYSIWYG HTML editor on the internet. you can also just keep it as a local file, if you want :3

download the proxy as an html file so that you can use this as a local file, making it unblockable, and better than any 3rd rate half baked blacklisted and blockable actual web proxy. _bite me titanium_. it has no history, no cache, no cookies, nothing. it won't leave a trace in your browser, and just rename the file something like "(skid)'s summer homework" if you think someones gonna snoop through your files. it has tons upon tons of options and settings, plus extra cloaking if you think your admin is fuckign Kevin Mitnick lookign or something. Switch your proxy tyoe, read the changelog, compare stats with other well known true proxies, go nuts. i have a website for it too by the way, so check it out at https://dinguschan-owo.github.io/dingusproxy/. you can also check out the backup (its the same) at https://dingusproxy.vercel.app/

### ***Usage Instructions***

is there a brain in that head or is it just for decoration? just visit the website i linked, or download it from the page ur on _right now_, then open the html file and follow the conviently placed and beautifully styled on screen instructions. seriously dude, this shits so simple a kindergartner could do it. Also, if you find something isn't loading, hit the proxy button and switch to a different proxy. trust me.

### ***Update Schedule***

fuck you there is no update schedule ill push updates whenever i fucking feel like it. i promise it'll get constantly updated though, because i love you guys (litrally nobody) :33
