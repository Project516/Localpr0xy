this is the original dingusProxy, built entirely from scratch by dinguschan! this project will get constant updates, but dont even think about gettign a consistent update schedule. open an issue for any spelling mistakes you see, so that i can ignore, it mark it as closed, and tell you to get stuffed üëç. 

for all the lil skid middle schoolers who searched "school proxy github" on their 200 dollar school chromebook, this thing is what you want. spyware and filters can't touch it. yes, its currently kinda shit, but again, constant updates. better than any other "uNbLoCkAbLe LoCaL wEb PrOxY" on the internet, trust. host this on Netlify, Heroku, Vercel, whatever. Copy and paste into Codepen, Replit, or any WYSIWYG HTML editor on the internet, or just keep it as a local file :3

download the proxy as an html file so that you can use this as a local file, making it unblockable, and better than any 3rd rate blockable titanium network proxy. bite me titanium. it has no history, no cache, no cookies, nothing. tons of options and settings, plus extra cloaking if you think your admin is fuckign Kevin Mitnick or something. Switch your proxy tyoe, read the changelog, compare stats with other well known true proxies, go nuts. i have a website for it too by the way, so check it out here! https://dinguschan-owo.github.io/dingusproxy/
